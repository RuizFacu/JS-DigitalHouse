This autumn I started a course of Web Programming at Digital House, a well-know school in Argentina.

This course was my way of getting into this whole new world for me and I have really enjoyed it.

In my different repositories you will find the practice I have done to become a Web Developer.

In JS Digital House  you will find my learning JS experience. 

Content such as Arrow Functions, setting up a Server, If, Switch, Array Methods, String Methods, Callbacks, etc.
